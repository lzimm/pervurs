-- this is fairly old school work yo --

way back when, i figured it'd be a cool idea to write a blog platform
that only hosted post content and offset commenting to another app.

the blog platform would let you do a bunch of fancy ass stuff to super
stylify each post and all that, and since the commenting platform
(which is where most of the writes for such an app would happen) was
separate (ala disqus n' shit), you could cache the crap out of everything
on the actual blog, and if you somehow got swamped with traffic, comments
would go down (but who cares, cuz you could just scale that crap orthagonally)
without disrupting your ego.

i'll probably post the commenting thing eventually too. it was basically a
several version precursor to http://360.io (ie: real-time bullshit that lets
you own the style of your comments: there's a lot of weird philosophical that i
cooked up behind all this btw)

anyways, standard disclaimer:

there's a bunch of extra junk in here you probably don't need to run it,
while on the other hand, its probably missing some stuff you do
(as well as any explanation of how all this junk works,
license information that i probably stripped from a bunch of files
and any sort of sanity). so funny.
